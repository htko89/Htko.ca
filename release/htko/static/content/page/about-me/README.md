# About Me
I am **Hei Tony Ko**, Front End Web Developer.

I currently specialize in **Front End: JS Frameworks, Node.JS, Responsive CSS and UI**, but I also often get my hands dirty with back end skills in **Python, Wordpress and Node.JS**.

**For almost a decade**, I have been fascinated with the idea of working with front-end technologies, magic and possibilities of HTML / CSS / Javascript.

**For the last year**, I have focused my efforts to fully develop this desire into a complete career.

* Previous experience: **Junior Designer ([Ko's Interior Design](http://kosinteriordesign.com/))**
* Current experience: **Front End Development Certification (WIP) ([Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/))**
  * See current progress dynamically! [FreeCodeCamp Journal](http://htko.ca/project/code/fcc/free-code-camp/README/)
  * Career aim: **Data Vis.**, **Back End** and **Full Stack Certificates** in the future.

As a whole, I hope to bring a unique **developer-designer** perspective to my work.
