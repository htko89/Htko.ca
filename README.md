Codebase for personal portfolio.

## Goals
I've decided to re-write my portfolio website. 
1. As an exercise to display my skills, I will be rewriting the current wordpress template as a static website of my own code. 
2. Eventually, I plan to completely create a new animated and highly responsive design, using new skills I've gained so far.
