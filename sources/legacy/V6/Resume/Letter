Dear Ontario Tile & Ceramics,

I am enquiring about your "Sales / Design" role offered on Indeed.ca. Please see my profile for work history and more. 

In my previous role as Electrical Contractor for Koâ€™s Interior Design, I have achieved record client referrals and over 40+ projects completed. In addition, I have been doing part time design work in Autodesk Revit & Chief Architect X6 for my family firm. Clients include small scale commercial, and full home residential remodelling. 

Having studied in Environmental Design at OCAD University for over 3 years, I have developed a wide range of skills that would meet, and exceed the expectations for the roles you may offer. See my Design Portfolio at: www.htko.ca. I have had achievements including being a school representative for Georgian College in the IIDEX NEOCON 2010 Student Charrette. Please see my LinkedIn at lnked.in/htko89

I would relish the opportunity to bring this level of success to your company. If you would like to get in touch to discuss open positions and to arrange an interview, you can contact me via 6473009787, or email at htko89@gmail.com.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best,

Tony
